Day after 
day, week 
after week
, passed a
way on my 
return to 
Geneva; an
d I could 
not collec
t the cour
age to rec
ommence my
 work. I f
eared the 
vengeance 
of the dis
appointed 
fiend, yet
 I was una
ble to ove
rcome my r
epugnance 
to the tas
k which wa
s enjoined
 me. I fou
nd that I 
could not 
compose a 
female wit
hout again
 devoting 
several mo
nths to pr
ofound stu
dy and lab
orious dis
quisition.
 I had hea
rd of some
 discoveri
es having 
been made 
by an Engl
ish philos
opher, the
 knowledge
 of which 
was materi
al to my s
uccess, an
d I someti
mes though
t of obtai
ning my fa
ther's con
sent to vi
sit Englan
d for this
 purpose; 
but I clun
g to every
 pretence 
of delay a
nd shrank 
from takin
g the firs
t step in 
an underta
king whose
 immediate
 necessity
 began to 
appear les
s absolute
 to me. A 
change ind
eed had ta
ken place 
in me; my 
health, wh
ich had hi
therto dec
lined, was
 now much 
restored; 
and my spi
rits, when
 unchecked
 by the me
mory of my
 unhappy p
romise, ro
se proport
ionably. M
y father s
aw this ch
ange with 
pleasure, 
and he tur
ned his th
oughts tow
ards the b
est method
 of eradic
ating the 
remains of
 my melanc
holy, whic
h every no
w and then
 would ret
urn by fit
s, and wit
h a devour
ing blackn
ess overca
st the app
roaching s
unshine. A
t these mo
ments I to
ok refuge 
in the mos
t perfect 
solitude. 
I passed w
hole days 
on the lak
e alone in
 a little 
boat, watc
hing the c
louds and 
listening 
to the rip
pling of t
he waves, 
silent and
 listless.
 But the f
resh air a
nd bright 
sun seldom
 failed to
 restore m
e to some 
degree of 
composure,
 and on my
 return I 
met the sa
lutations 
of my frie
nds with a
 readier s
mile and a
 more chee
rful heart
.
